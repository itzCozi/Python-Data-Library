# Python Data Library
The Python Data Library is a python library file and parser pypi-package, To create a `.pdl` file simply follow this [wiki guide](https://github.com/itzCozi/Python-Developer-Library/wiki). PDL files are marked by the file extension `.pdl` and can be parsed within a python program using the pdlparse pypi package. The file's syntax is made to be simple and easy to learn it follows very pythonic rules to ease developers into the language. `pdl-hl` is the [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CooperRansom.pdl-hl) made for pdl files it offers custom syntax highlighting for python data librarys depending on your color theme.

# Python Data Library Syntax-Highlighting

pdl-hl stands for Python Data Library Highlighter and it supports custom syntax highlighting for `.pdl` files in VSCode depending on your color theme.

## Features

The only thing pdl-hl does is syntax highlighting and pdl language support once installed it should automaticly highlight within the `.pdl` file. If not press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to pull the command pallete up then type `change langauge mode` and search `pdl` then press `Enter` keywords, comments, types and doc-strings are highlighted.

## Requirements

pdl-hl is syntax highlighting for Python Data Librarys so its recommended [python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/) is installed to use the created `.pdl` files in programs it is also good to have the [PDL pypi package](https://pypi.org/project/pdlparse/)

## Releases and Updates

This is the one and only release there will ever be of pdl-hl there are no live updates unless I get bored and return to this project for a 'revamp'. The syntax of pdl is made to be simple so this extension is not complicated at all, just simple highlighting however my python package [pdlparse](https://pypi.org/project/pdlparse/) will continue to get updates periodically.
